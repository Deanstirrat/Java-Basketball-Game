# Java-Basketball-Game

Simple java basketball game. Final Project for ECS 102.

This is a game I made during the final weeks of my first semester at University. The goal of the project was to impliment all the topics we had covered as a class that semester into a coherant playable game. I choose a basketball theme that uses imported files with team stats to populate the game with playable NBA basketball teams/players.
